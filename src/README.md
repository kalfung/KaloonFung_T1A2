## **Purpose**

The purpose of this website is to:
- present in an online portfolio a showcase of my projects, skills, and professional knowledge
- provide information about my work and education history, and interests
- make a great first impression for prospective employers and clients
- express my personality and capabilities through its clean and minimalist design 

## **Target audience**

The target audience for this portfolio website are potential employers seeking to engage a junior web developer and IT professional. This website will demonstrate to them my technical knowledge of information technology, software development/codin, programming languages and development stacks. 

The audience for this website also includes my fellow students that would like to collaborate with someone with a great work ethic and professional attitude.

## **Functionality and features**

This website was made using HTML and CSS and designed to be responsive across all display sizes. I have created five main pages and five blog entry pages that all follow an aesethetic theme that features:
- Utilisation of HTML5 semantic elements to make the code more informative and to cater for accessibility and screen readers. 
- A fully responsive layout with media queries at 750px and 1200px viewport widths to cater for mobile, tablet and desktop displays.
- Maximum widths for certain graphical and text elements so that users with larger displays aren't presented with dense walls of content.
- Increased margins on larger displays to increase reading comfort on wide viewports.
- A fully functional and hover-animated fixed navigation bar at the top to provide easy navigation throughout all parts of the website.
- A hero element with the author's name to capture the viewer's attention.
- A footer component with a call to action to contact me and links to my social media and professional accounts.
- Consistent grey-to-blue hover animations created using pseudo-clases to indicate text and graphical hyperlinks throughout the site that
 increase functionality.
- A consistent blue and grey colour scheme, font family, animations, and use of white space that presents a professional and unified minimalist aesthetic. 

There are five main pages on this website:
1. Index / Home page: this is the landing page that greets the visitor with a brief description about myself 
2. About page: this page has some information about my work history and interests. This page also has a section with an email link and a link to a PDF copy of my resume.
3. Projects page: this page will showcase my coding projects and is currently a work in progress. It will be updated in the coming months as my skillset grows. It currently has four preview cards containing placeholder information.
4. Blog page: this page has preview cards for five blog entries, each hyperlinking to their respective blog entry pages. Each preview card features a thumbnail of the blog image, title, subtitle, and date of post. Each blog entry's page contains one relevant image with text wrapping around it. There is also a hyperlink at the bottom of each blog entry that returns the user to the main blog page.
5. Contact page: this page features a text-entry "Contact Me" form that allows viewers to enter their name and email address together with a message. The form is currently non-functional. JavaScript will be added in the future to this form so it can actually capture information.
